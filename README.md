## fixing a bug

*ngFor="let ingredientCtrl of recipeForm.get('ingredients').controls; let i = index"

This code will fail with the latest Angular version.

You can fix it easily though. Outsource the "get the controls" logic into a getter of your component code (the .ts file):

    get controls() { // a getter!
      return (<FormArray>this.recipeForm.get('ingredients')).controls;
    }

In the template, you can then use:

*ngFor="let ingredientCtrl of controls; let i = index"

This adjustment is required due to the way TS works and Angular parses your templates (it doesn't understand TS there).

## Deleting all Items in a FormArray
As of Angular 8+, there's a new way of clearing all items in a FormArray.

    (<FormArray>this.recipeForm.get('ingredients')).clear();

The clear() method automatically loops through all registered FormControls (or FormGroups) in the FormArray and removes them.

It's like manually creating a loop and calling removeAt() for every item.
